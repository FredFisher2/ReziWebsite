# What is Rezi.one?
Rezi.one is a pirated game search engine targeted at newer users to the piracy scene. The goal was to create a search engine that would have every game imaginiable while still being faster than any other search engine such as Google or DuckDuckGo. This is the second iteration of the Rezi Project after the [Rezi Bot](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/Rezi) broke, instead of using a discord interface, it is now in a website. This site basically does everything the Rezi Bot did except it runs on a website and is much faster. It gets games by scraping the sources sites every 24 hours and adds it to the search engine with all the necessary data so you can search by it. 

# Is there an API?
Yes! You can find all the documentation including keys at [the Rezi Docs](https://docs.rezi.one). There are other things in there than the API such as best searching practices, how to download safely and the sources used for all these games. These docs also allow you to try out requests to see how they work and what a request would look like in different languages. Pretty neat!

# Sources
You can find all the sources used in [the Rezi Docs](https://docs.rezi.one). If you would like to add a new source, make an issue and I'll try to get to it as soon as I can. I work on [other projects](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev) so I can't get to everything, but I will eventually!

# What about the Rezi Bot?
[Rezi Bot](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/Rezi) has been discontinued due to low interest and Discord piracy control getting very strict. I don't want to see any servers die due to my bot, so I decided to remove it. You can still run it yourself by going to the Github, or even create your own bot using the [Rezi API](https://docs.rezi.one).

# Piracy
Yes, of course, I made it for piracy. **As a reminder, this site will never host any content other than just links, so it will never be taken down for piracy for any reason, and as it is open-source, anybody could start their own site using the same principles if they wanted.** 

# How can I help?
Good question! If you would like to help you can either donate (helps me out a lot). Also, if you find a problem, please report it in the issues tab in this [github](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/ReziWebsite/issues/new/choose) so I can fix it! Although the project will still recieve minor adjustments and fixes, I am not really updating this project anymore. There will *most likely* not be any more major updates. Feel free to fork and create a new site if you would like to add more major features.
